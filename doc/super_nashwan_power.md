Dear Rebellion,
I read that you have acquired The Bitmap Brothers brand and portfolio. I am working on a game as a hobby project. It's a PvP vehicle combat game. I want to include a "Super Nashwan Power" powerup as an eastereggy reference to Xenon2. It would give the player the same weapon configuration as it does in Xenon for 10 seconds. Is that cool with you? I don't want to risk any legal trouble.
The game is free and open source, if we ever make money with it it will be through something like patreon. We are not going to claim any affiliation with or endorsement by you.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Cheers!
Mirko



Hi Mirko,
 
Thank you for your interest however, I'm afraid this is not something we can offer.
 
Best of luck with the project!
 
Kind regards,
 
Imi
