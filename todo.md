* shake camera upon explosion
* powerups should not be bounced against when collected
* glider jumps around after spawning
* some nice sounds
* reset() everything on game end? (alternatively reload the window...)
* coast looks shit (maybe white foam as part of mountain texture, semi covered by waves?)
* why 115 fps physics?

for Dani:

* k√ºmmer that testing works again
* make that index.html does not disappear
* npm run autoformat-all-files-in-src-and-experiments
* raise performance warning size limit (but don't disable it)

* maybe migrate to deno2 to fix all of the above
