* await stuff in parallel
* action cam should include powerups
* action cam should be second order low passed
* action cam should wait until an explosion is finished
* powerups should not be bounced against when collected

for Dani:

* k√ºmmer that testing works again
* make that index.html does not disappear
* npm run autoformat-all-files-in-src-and-experiments
* raise performance warning size limit (but don't disable it)
