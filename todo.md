* shake camera upon explosion
* glider jumps around after spawning
* some nice sounds
* reset() everything on game end? (alternatively reload the window...)
* coast looks shit (maybe white foam as part of mountain texture, semi covered by waves?)
* mines should not be pooped into the wall, they should be sunk and appear after a second and if the glider is still there explode on it
* the powerup boxes need more pizzazz, they somehow fade into the background. Emissiveness?
* implement standard shields and phaser charge
* tune nashwan damage
* things should not spawn into each other, have more spawning points or maybe spawning 
* refactor this extra update handler member everywhere
areas and also check if a spawn place is free
* vec utils (euler, temp, etc)
* missile explodes parent
* config file
* missile smoke
* nashwan missiles must accelerate and explode and smoke

for Dani:

* k√ºmmer that testing works again
* make that index.html does not disappear
* npm run autoformat-all-files-in-src-and-experiments
* raise performance warning size limit (but don't disable it)

* maybe migrate to deno2 to fix all of the above
