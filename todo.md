* shake camera upon explosion
* powerups should not be bounced against when collected (?):
	This is a bit tricky. A powerup has a mass and a glider collecting a powerup is triggered after the impact. Or we ignore the collision but then it's not triggered. We can either create either restore the glider velocity after collecting a powerup (which is bad because it will also ignore other simultaneous collisions that should not be ignored) or we ignore the collision but the powerup drags a glider detector around which has mass 0 but that's a bit ugly.
	Or we just live with the fact that gliders get slowed down by colliding with powerup boxes :)
	p2 has sensors, maybe we can somehow implement that but probably still tricky because the powerups are supposed to collide normally with other objects
* glider jumps around after spawning
* some nice sounds
* reset() everything on game end? (alternatively reload the window...)
* coast looks shit (maybe white foam as part of mountain texture, semi covered by waves?)
* mines should not be pooped into the wall

for Dani:

* k√ºmmer that testing works again
* make that index.html does not disappear
* npm run autoformat-all-files-in-src-and-experiments
* raise performance warning size limit (but don't disable it)

* maybe migrate to deno2 to fix all of the above
